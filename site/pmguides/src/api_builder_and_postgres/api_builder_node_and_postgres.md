# Build An API with Postman, Node.js & Postgres

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Overview

Duration: 2

Let's create a ToDo API powered by Postgres and Node.js with the help of Postman's [API Builder](https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/creating-an-api/#creating-an-api)

### Prerequisites

- Basic experience with Postman Collections
- At least a beginner understanding of Node.js
- Comfort with the command line / shell

### What You Will Learn

- How to create an API in Postman with an OpenAPI 3 definition.
- How to generate skeleton code for the API, using Postman.
- How to flesh out the code with a connection to Postgres and business logic.
- How to generate a Postman Collection from the API definition and send requests to the API.

### What You Will Need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) Installed and in your path (required)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) Installed
- [The Visual Studio Code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) Installed (recommended)

### What You Will Build

- A ToDo API with Postgres & Node.js and a Postman Collection for it.

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Install The Prerequisites

Duration: 7

### Installing Node.js

[Download the Node.js installer for your operating system](https://nodejs.org/en/download). The installer will generally add Node to your path for you. After installation, open a command line terminal and test that it's in your path by typing `node --version` at the command prompt.

If installed successfully, it will tell you the version you're running.

### Installing Postgres

Download the [Postgres GUI installer](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) for your operating system and install Postgres. Follow the prompts, accept the defaults, and make sure to write down the password you set for the **postgres** user.

In the next step, let's create the database and user for the API back-end.

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Create The Database

Duration: 7

Let's create the database for the ToDo items. This section assumes you've installed Postgres. As part of its base installation, it installs a shell application called **psql**. This may not be automatically added to your path. Search for it in your operating system's search prompt and run it. It will open a terminal window and ask for some information to connect to the server.

Accept the defaults for `server`,`database`, `port`, and `username`. When you get to `password`, use the password you set for the **postgres** user in the previous section.

![psql login](./assets/psql_login.png)

Run the following commands in the terminal window, one at a time. Remember that the semicolon is required at the end of the command.

1. Create the database.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE todo WITH OWNER postgres;
```

2. Switch to using the database for further commands. Following this, the command prompt will change from `postgres=#` to `todo=#`.

```sql
\c todo
```

3. Create a user for the API. Before you do this, the only other user is **postgres** and that is a superuser role with _all of the privileges_ on the database. Creating a new role and scoping it just to the permissions required to do its work is always a good practice.

```sql
CREATE USER todo_admin WITH PASSWORD 'leelu_dallas_multipass_6';
```

4. Create the database table to hold your ToDo items. This has three fields:

- `id_code`: a unique key of (up 36 characters).
- `to_do`: the task to be done (up to 255 characters).
- `completed`: whether or not it's been completed (boolean).

```sql
CREATE TABLE todos (id_code varchar(36) NOT NULL UNIQUE, to_do varchar(255) NOT NULL, completed boolean);
```

5. Grant the required privileges on the `todos` table to the new user.

```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON todos TO todo_admin;
```

6. At this point, the scaffolding is done, but let's add two items to the database so there's something when you start sending requests.

Item 1:

```sql
INSERT INTO todos (id_code, to_do, completed) VALUES ('todo1','Get something done', TRUE);
```

Item 2:

```sql
INSERT INTO todos (id_code, to_do, completed) VALUES ('todo2','Get another thing done', FALSE);
```

7. Query the database to see the two items you added.

```sql
SELECT * FROM todos;
```

![psql SELECT query](./assets/psql_select.png)

8. Quit out of the Postgres shell.

```bash
\q
```

Next, use OpenAPI to define an API.

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Define the API

Duration: 7

A good way to describe an API is to use the [OpenAPI 3 standard](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html), which describes the API in a machine-readable format.

Let's break up the description for better human readability and get an overview of how this is composed.

[Download the full version of this API specification](https://gist.github.com/LetMyPeopleCode/99abd6eea4894d149971e98113e29076) if you want to see it in its entirety.

### The metadata

First, let's look at the metadata. You provide the version of OpenAPI you're using and an `info` object with information about the API that isn't necessarily crucial to its operation.

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: My ToDo API
  description: Create, read, edit, and complete tasks.
  version: 0.1.0
```

### The `servers` array

Next is a `servers` array with an object for each server, like development and production. A `variables` object provides values for each server, such as the selection of port 8080 as the default.

```yaml
servers:
  - url: http://localhost
    description: Development server
    variables:
      port:
        default: 8080
```

### The `components` object

In the `components` object, there is a `schemas` object to define each type of data the API will send or receive. Data types like the `id_code` will be used in multiple places. The `$ref: [path to object]` property reuses the existing `id_code` definition in the `to_do` object.

Note how the strings have `minLength` and `maxLength` values. Information like this is helpful for implementers and machine-generated documentation.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    id_code:
      description: An UUID identifying an individual task.
      type: string
      minLength: 1
      maxLength: 36
    task:
      description: The text description of the task.
      type: string
      minLength: 2
      maxLength: 255
    completed:
      description: True means the task is complete, false means it is not.
      type: boolean
    complete:
      description: Use true to show all tasks, false to show only incomplete tasks.
      type: boolean
    to_do:
      description: An object containing a task's information
      type: object
      properties:
        idcode:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/id_code"
        task:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/task"
        completed:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/completed"
    to_do_list:
      description: An array of toDo objects.
      type: array
      items:
        $ref: "#/components/schemas/ToDo"
    error_msg:
      type: object
      properties:
        message:
          type: string
```

### The `paths` object

The `paths` object defines the paths for your API and how they handle various HTTP verbs like `PUT` and `GET`.

This API has a single path of `/todo` with definitions of what is required and what will be returned, depending on the type of action.

References to the data types (`$ref:`) from the `schemas` section are used here to keep the definitions shorter, adhere to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles, and stay consistent.

Here are the action types and how they're defined:

- **GET**: Returns a list of all ToDos that have not been marked complete. If a `complete` parameter (boolean) is added to the request and the value is `true`, completed ToDos will be included in the list.

- **POST**: Creates a new ToDo. It requires the data be submitted as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` with a `task` parameter (string) with the text of the ToDo (up to 255 characters). A `complete` parameter (boolean) is optional if you want the task to be marked as already complete when you add it.

- **PUT**: Updates an existing ToDo. It requires the data be submitted as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. It requires at least one of the following parameters and can contain both:
  - A `task` parameter (string) with the updated text of the ToDo (up to 255 characters).
  - A `completed` parameter (boolean) to update the status.

```yaml
paths:
  /todo:
    get:
      description: Gets a list of all items or all incomplete items.
      parameters:
        - name: complete
          in: query
          required: false
          schema:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/complete"
      responses:
        "200":
          description: OK
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: "#/components/schemas/to_do_list"
    post:
      description: Create a to-do item.
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/x-www-form-urlencoded:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                task:
                  $ref: "#/components/schemas/task"
                completed:
                  $ref: "#/components/schemas/completed"
              required:
                - task
      responses:
        "200":
          description: Returns a copy of the new ToDo object.
          content:
            "application/json":
              schema:
                $ref: "#/components/schemas/to_do"
        "400":
          description: Creation failed. Returns an error.
          content:
            "application/json":
              schema:
                $ref: "#/components/schemas/error_msg"
    put:
      description: Update a to-do item.
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/x-www-form-urlencoded:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                id_code:
                  $ref: "#/components/schemas/id_code"
                task:
                  $ref: "#/components/schemas/task"
                completed:
                  $ref: "#/components/schemas/completed"
              required:
                - id_code
      responses:
        "200":
          description: Item updated. Returns the item's updated ToDo object.
          content:
            "application/json":
              schema:
                $ref: "#/components/schemas/to_do"
        "400":
          description: Update failed. Returns an error message.
          content:
            "application/json":
              schema:
                $ref: "#/components/schemas/error_msg"
```

Read the [OpenAPI 3 standard](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html) if you'd like to dive deeper into constructing API definitions with it.

Next, add the API to Postman.

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Add the API to Postman

Duration: 7

With the Postman app or web client open, go to your **Personal Collection** and select the **APIs** icon. Then **Create an API**.

![APIs section](./assets/no_api.png)

The API is created, but it's untitled and empty.

1. Name it "ToDos" by selecting the pencil icon that appears when you hover over the name.
2. Select the **+** symbol to the right of the **Definition** option. It presents a submenu of **Import files** or **Author from scratch**.
3. Select **Author from scratch**.
4. Select or accept `OpenAPI 3.0` as the **Definition type** and `YAML` as the **Definition Format**.
5. Select **Create Definition**. This opens a code editor.
6. Copy the [full ToDo API definition from this link](https://gist.github.com/LetMyPeopleCode/99abd6eea4894d149971e98113e29076).
7. Paste the definition into the code editor.
   ![api definition](./assets/api_definition.png)
8. Select **Save**.

You're ready to code your API in the next step.

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Code the API

Duration: 7

Postman offers code generation to scaffold your API for multiple programming languages. This project uses Node.js.

Return to the top level of the API in the navigation. Select the **`&lt;/&gt;`** icon to open the code generator.

![code generator icon](./assets/codegen.png)

The wizard asks what **Language and framework** you want and offers an option to **Only generate routes and interfaces**. Choose **NodeJs - Express** as the language and framework and leave option to limit what it generates unchecked.

Select **Generate code** and it will prompt you to download a zip file.

If you do not want to download and update the code, there is a link to fully functioning API code at the end of this section. The rest of this section focuses on adding a database connection and the code for the GET method as an example.

### Going the DIY route

If you want to code this yourself, take these preliminary steps.

1. Unzip the code you downloaded into a project folder.
2. Open a terminal window and navigate into the project folder.
3. Enter `npm install` in the terminal window. This will install the prerequisites specified by the gode generator.
4. [Add a Postgres connector for Express](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/database-integration.html#Postgres). This code will also add it to your `project.json` file in case you're planning to save this to source control and skip this step in the future.

```bash
npm install pg-promise --save
```

Enter `npm run start` in the terminal window.

At this point, the server will run and return mock data that looks like a single entry. By default, the server runs at port 3000. When it's running, go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and it will return the results of a `GET`. Enter `ctrl` + `c` in the terminal window to stop it.

#### Editing server.js

Note how you had to go to port 3000 above, but the API definition specifies port 8080.

In the project root folder, open `server.js` with an editor. At or around line 10, replace the value of 3000 with 8080 in this line.

```javascript
  // old
    PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000,
```

```javascript
  // new
    PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080,
```

Save it and move on.

#### Editing `services/todos.js`

Navigate from the root folder of the project to the `services` folder and open `todos.js` in an editor. This file is where the business logic lives and where the root functions for the API methods live.

Add the following code at the top.

```javascript
const crypto = require("crypto");
const pgp = require("pg-promise")();
const db = pgp(
  "postgres://todo_admin:leelu_dallas_multipass_6@localhost:5432/todo"
);
const PS = pgp.PreparedStatement;
```

This pulls in Node's built-in `crypto` module to generate UUIDs for the `POST` function and sets up the `Postgres` module with a database connection. Then it simplifies the `pg-promise` module's class for prepared functions, which is used to ensure booleans are properly handled in the database queries.

Let's look at the code for the `GET` function from above. It creates a demo of the array specified in the API description with mock values.

```javascript
var data = [
    {
      complete: "<Complete>",
      idcode: "<IdCode>",
      task: "<Task>",
    },
  ],
  status = "200";

return {
  status: status,
  data: data,
};
```

Replace that code with this code and save the file.

```javascript
//compose the query
let listTodos = {};
let result = {};

// create a query with a prepared statement
if (options.completed && options.completed.toLowerCase() === "true") {
  listTodos = new PS({ name: "list-all-todos", text: "SELECT * FROM todos" });
} else {
  listTodos = new PS({
    name: "list-todos",
    text: "SELECT * FROM todos WHERE completed = $1",
    values: false,
  });
}

//query the database
try {
  result = await db.any(listTodos);
} catch (err) {
  console.log(err);
  throw new Error(err);
}

return {
  status: 200,
  data: result,
};
```

Express provides the query string parameters in the `options` object. First, the code checks if there is a `completed` parameter and then if the value is `true` (as a string). The default is only to get all ToDos that are not completed. The modified query when `completed` is `true` gets all ToDos, regardless of status.

If you want to dig into the code for the other two operations, download the complete working code at the [ToDo API project repository on GitHub](https://github.com/LetMyPeopleCode/ToDO_API_with_Node_and_Postgres).

Next, let's put the API through its paces with Postman.

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Run Some Postman Requests

Duration: 7

### Generate a Postman Collection

Return to the API you created in Postman. Select the **+** icon by **Collections** and choose **Generate from definition**.

![Start the generation](./assets/generate_collection_step_1.png)

In the generator details, give your collection a name, leave the rest of the values at their defaults, and select **Generate Collection**.

![Name the collection](./assets/generate_collection_step_2.png)

When the collection is generated, it is a child of the API, not the higher-level **Collections** part of the workspace. Queries for `GET`, `POST`. and `PUT` are created.

### Run a ToDo server

Make sure your Postgres database is running in the XAMPP control panel.

1. Clone the [ToDo API Project repository](https://github.com/LetMyPeopleCode/ToDO_API_with_Node_and_Postgres) from GitHub into a local folder.
2. Open a terminal and navigate into the top-level directory.
3. In the terminal, issue the command: `npm install`.
4. When that completes, issue the command: `node server.js`

You're ready to try your queries. The SQL you ran previously pre-populated the database with two items, so you have some data.

### Try a `GET`

Select **Send** and the API will return an array with the incomplete ToDo as an object.

![API GET demo](./assets/first_get.png)

**NOTE:** You may need to have the Postman Desktop Agent running or the **Send** button will be disabled.

Try changing **&lt;boolean&gt;** in the parameters to `true` to get an array with both of the ToDo objects.

### Try a `POST`

Select the `POST` from the collection then select the **Body** tab to see the parameters.

Replace them with a task you want to add and its completion status. The task string is defined as being between 2 and 255 characters long. The status must be the word "true" or "false" in lowercase or Postman will note a validation error. If you uncheck it, the server will default to `false`.

Select **Send** to add the task to the database. It will return a ToDo object with the values you submitted and the generated `id_code`.

![POST results](./assets/post_results.png)

Go back to the `GET` and run it if you want to confirm the task was added to the database.

### Try a `PUT`

Like the `POST`, the parameters are in the **Body** tab.

The only required item is the `id_code`. If you want to submit an empty field for the `task` or `complete` fields, uncheck them on the left rather than changing the mock value to an empty one. If you uncheck both, the server returns a `400 Bad Request` because there's nothing to update.

1. Set the `id_code` field to "todo2" (one of the pre-populated ToDo items)
2. Set `complete` to "true", and uncheck the `task` field. This will update the database entry as completed.
3. Select **Send**.

The server makes the change, then queries the database for the item and returns the whole item to confirm the update.

![PUT results](./assets/put_results.png)

Go back to the `GET` and run it with `completed` unchecked to see the task is no longer active.

You're done. Congratulations! You've defined an API with OpenAPI 3.0, generated skeleton server code, generated a Postman Collection to send requests to the server, and made changes to the database.

Next, look at some ways you can continue with this.

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Next Steps

Duration: 1

Here are some things you can do if you want to learn more.

- Read the [OpenAPI 3 standard](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html) and add a `DELETE` method to the API specification.

- Update the Postgres server permissions for `todo_admin` and Node.js server code to add a `DELETE` method, then regenerate your collection to test the `DELETE` method.

- Clean up your system by uninstalling Node.js and Postgres if you don't intend to keep them.
