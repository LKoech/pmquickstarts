# Home Assistant with WebSocket APIs

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Overview

Duration: 1

### Prerequisites

- Familiarity with DIY home automation and Home Assistant
- Some connected device, such as smart lights, smart speakers, or digital assistant

### What You’ll Learn

- how to establish a WebSockets connection
- how to authorize Home Assistant APIs
- how to send and receive WebSocket messages

### What You’ll Need

- a [Home Assistant Account](https://www.home-assistant.io/)
  - Home Assistant instance running on local server, [such as Raspberry Pi](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/raspberrypi)

## Introduction to Home Assistant

Duration: 2

### REST and WebSockets for connected home

When it comes to transmitting data in a connected home environment, both REST and WebSockets are commonly used protocols, but they have different characteristics and use cases.

REST follows a request-response pattern, where a client sends a request to a server, and the server responds with the requested data. This is useful for accessing and controlling smart devices and services, and works well for scenarios where data updates are not required in real-time. For example, REST is suitable for a one-off request to turn on a smart light.

On the other hand, WebSockets enables bidirectional communication between a client and server, enabling real-time data transmission. This is useful for applications that require continuous data updates, such as real-time monitoring of sensor data and displaying live dashboards. For example, WebSockets is suitable for continuously monitoring the temperature in a room over a persistent connection.

In the next section, let’s take a look at a popular home automation platform that provides both REST and WebSocket APIs.

### Home Assistant for home automation

[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) is a popular open-source home automation platform that lets you control and monitor smart devices from different brands using a unified interface. Instead of using separate mobile apps to control your kitchen lights, thermostat, and smart coffee maker produced by different manufacturers, you can manage everything from a single Home Assistant dashboard running on a Raspberry Pi or other dedicated server within your local network.

Home Assistant is ideal for DIY smart home tinkerers because it supports a wide range of integrations and protocols, allowing you to create automation scenarios based on events, schedules, and sensor readings.

Next, let’s take a look at Home Assistant’s WebSocket API.

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Create Home Assistant long-lived token

Duration: 2

In addition to [a REST API](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/rest/),
Home Assistant also contains [a WebSocket API](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/websocket) to stream information. Using a long-lived token, you can use Postman to establish a connection with our Home Assistant server running locally, and then send and receive messages using the WebSocket API.

### Fork the Postman collection

1. Find the sample collection, [Home Assistant WebSockets](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/program-smart-lights/collection/6481ed9afe7f1bdfaa732408), and fork the collection to your own Postman workspace.
   ![fork icon](./assets/fork_icon.png)
1. Enter a label for your fork and select the workspace to fork the collection:
   ![fork label](./assets/fork.png)

### Create Home Assistant long-lived token

1. Log in to [Home Assistant](http://homeassistant.local:8123)
1. Create a long-lived access token from the [Home Assistant profile page](http://homeassistant.local:8123/profile).
   ![long lived token](./assets/long_lived.png)
1. Let's save our token as a Postman variable, so that we can use it in our API requests. Select the Postman collection that you forked to your workspace. Find the **Variables** tab, and paste your long-lived access token as the `token` variable value.
   ![save token as variable](./assets/token.png)
   > aside negative
   > If you are working in a public or team workspace, you may want to create [a Postman environment](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/) and use ["Current value"](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/) to prevent unintentional disclosure of sensitive data, such as authorization credentials.

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Establish a WebSockets connection

Duration: 3

### Authenticate the WebSockets connection

1. Select the Postman collection that you forked to your workspace. Open the "Home Assistant WebSocket API" request, and click the **Connect** button.
1. When a client connects to the server, the server sends out `auth_required`.In the **Response** pane, you can inspect the message returned from the WebSockets server. You can further inspect the connection details by clicking on "Connected to ws://homeassistant.local:8123/api/websocket". The connection established between the Postman client and local server is bidirectional. In addition to receiving messages, Postman can also send them.
   ![network connection details](./assets/connect.png)
1. The first message from the client should be an auth message that includes an access token. Under the **Message** tab, under **Saved messages**, select a message called `auth` to display a JSON message that includes your `token`. If you were busy inspecting, the server may have disconnected from Postman. **Connect** once again, and then **Send** the `auth` message.

### Send and receive messages

Once the connection is authenticated, you can send and receive messages. Select from **Saved messages** to initiate commands.

> aside negative
> During the command phase, the client attaches a unique identifier to each message. The server will add this identifier to each message so that the client can link each message to its origin.

1. The command `subscribe_events` will subscribe your client to the event bus. You can either listen to all events or to a specific event type. Find a **Saved message** called `subscribe_events` that contains the following message, and **Send**.

```json
{
  "id": 18,
  "type": "subscribe_events",
  "event_type": "state_changed"
}
```

1. Once you subscribe to listen to all events, you will receive a message when the state changes on any device connected to Home Assistant.
   ![show state changes](./assets/state_change.png)
1. For each message that you send or receive, you can expand the message details.
   ![show message details](./assets/message_details.png)
1. If the **Response** pane becomes too busy, you can **Clear messages**, and filter the messages by text or sent or received.
   ![show message details](./assets/filter.png)

Continue exploring the other **Saved messages** within this collection. Once you learn how to work with Home Assistant WebSockets APIs, you can build your own custom integrations and notifications.
